Assignment A:
1.	Download this TINY IMAGENET (http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip)dataset. 
2.	Train ResNet18 on this dataset (70/30 split) for 50 Epochs. Target 50%+ Validation Accuracy. 
3.	Submit Results. Of course, you are using your own package for everything.



Assignment B:
1.	Download 50 images of dogs. 
2.	Use this (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/via_demo.html) to annotate bounding boxes around the dogs.
3.	Download JSON file. 
4.	Describe the contents of this JSON file in FULL details (you don't need to describe all 10 instances, anyone would work). 
5.	Refer to this tutorial (https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms-part-9-k-means-example-in-python-f2ad05ed5203). Find out the best total numbers of clusters. Upload link to your Colab File uploaded to GitHub.
